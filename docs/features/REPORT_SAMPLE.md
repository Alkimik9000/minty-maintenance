# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 1 — Creating a Safety Checkpoint
# ------------------------------------------------------------

📸 First, let me mark your current system state as a safe point to return to if needed.

Think of this like saving your game before a boss fight - if anything goes wrong, we can restore everything back to exactly how it is right now.

⚠️ NOTE: Timeshift checkpoint functionality is currently disabled.
   This feature will be re-enabled in a future update.
   For now, please create snapshots manually using the Timeshift GUI.

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 2 — Updating Command-Line Tools (Homebrew)
# ------------------------------------------------------------

🍺 Homebrew manages special command-line tools that aren't in the regular software store.

You don't have Homebrew installed. That's fine - you probably don't need it unless you're a developer.

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 3 — Updating Your Core System Software
# ------------------------------------------------------------

📦 Now for the important part - updating your system's core software. This includes security fixes and bug repairs.

This is like getting oil changes for your car - it keeps everything running smoothly and safely.

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 4 — Checking for Package Issues
# ------------------------------------------------------------

🔍 Let me check if any software is being held back or if there are any orphaned packages taking up space...

✅ No packages are being held back. Good!

🔧 Now I'm going to: install tool to find orphaned packages
   ✅ Done! Everything completed successfully.

🧹 Found 37 orphaned packages that aren't needed anymore:
   libavcodec58

[... continues for all orphaned packages ...]

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 5 — Updating Desktop Applications (Flatpak)
# ------------------------------------------------------------

📱 Flatpak apps are like phone apps - they run in their own secure space and update independently.

🔄 Updating your Flatpak applications...
You have 23 Flatpak apps installed.

🔧 Now I'm going to: update all Flatpak apps
   Looking for updates…

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 6 — Updating Snap Applications
# ------------------------------------------------------------

📦 Snap is another app system, similar to Flatpak. Let me check for updates and clean up old versions...

Snap keeps old versions of apps as backups. I'll limit this to save space.

🔧 Now I'm going to: update all Snap applications
   All snaps up to date.
   ✅ Done! Everything completed successfully.

🧹 Removing old app versions to free up space...

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 10 — Cleaning Up System Log Files
# ------------------------------------------------------------

📚 Your system keeps detailed logs of everything it does. Over time, these can take up quite a bit of space.

Let me clean up logs older than 2 weeks...
Current log storage: 4.2G

🔧 Now I'm going to: clean up old system logs (keep 2 weeks)
   Vacuuming done, freed 3.9G of archived journals on disk.
   ✅ Done! This freed up about 3,900MB of space.

Log storage after cleanup: 289M

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 11 — Removing Old System Kernels
# ------------------------------------------------------------

🖥️ The kernel is the core of your operating system. When it updates, old versions are kept as backups.

Let me clean up old kernels, keeping the newest 2...
You currently have 5 kernels installed.

🔧 Now I'm going to: remove old kernels (keeping newest 2)
   Removing linux-image-6.5.0-10-generic (6.5.0-10.10~22.04.1)

   ✅ Done! This freed up about 1,823MB of space.

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 14 — Cleaning Up Docker Containers
# ------------------------------------------------------------

🐳 Docker is used for running containerized applications. Let me check if cleanup is needed...

📊 Current Docker disk usage:
TYPE            TOTAL     ACTIVE    SIZE      RECLAIMABLE
Images          47        12        15.2GB    11.8GB (77%)

🔍 Checking what can be cleaned up...
This would remove:
   • All stopped containers
   • All networks not used by containers
   • All dangling images
   • All build cache

⚠️  Found 20 stopped containers and 35 unused images.

Cleaning up safely...

# Chapter 16 — Deep Cleaning Temporary Files
# ------------------------------------------------------------

🧹 BleachBit is like CCleaner for Linux - it removes temporary files, caches, and other junk.

This will clean things like:
   • Web browser caches
   • Temporary files
   • Old logs
   • Thumbnail caches

📋 Available cleaning options:
   adobe_reader.cache
   adobe_reader.mru
   adobe_reader.tmp
   amsn.cache
   amsn.chat_logs
   amule.logs
   amule.tmp
   apt.autoclean
   apt.autoremove
   apt.clean

🔧 Now I'm going to: perform deep clean (browser cache, temp files, logs)
   Cleaned 2,341 files (1.87GB)
   ✅ Done! This freed up about 1,870MB of space.

💡 Run BleachBit (GUI) to customize what gets cleaned.

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 17 — Optimizing SSD Performance
# ------------------------------------------------------------

⚡ If you have an SSD (solid-state drive), it needs periodic optimization to maintain performance.

This process is called 'trimming' and helps the drive manage deleted data efficiently.

🔧 Now I'm going to: optimize all SSD drives
   /: 89.4 GiB (95961874432 bytes) trimmed on /dev/nvme0n1p2
   /boot/efi: 504.6 MiB (529092608 bytes) trimmed on /dev/nvme0n1p1
   ✅ Done! Everything completed successfully.

📝 Note: You'll see errors for non-SSD drives or filesystems that don't support trimming. This is normal!

💡 Your system should do this automatically weekly, but running it manually ensures it's done.
