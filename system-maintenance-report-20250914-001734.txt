# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 1 — Creating a Safety Checkpoint
# ------------------------------------------------------------


📸 First, let me mark your current system state as a safe point to return to if needed.

Think of this like saving your game before a boss fight - if anything goes wrong, we can restore everything back to exactly how it is right now.

⚠️ NOTE: Timeshift checkpoint functionality is currently disabled.
   This feature will be re-enabled in a future update.
   For now, please create snapshots manually using the Timeshift GUI.

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 2 — Updating Command-Line Tools (Homebrew)
# ------------------------------------------------------------


🍺 Homebrew manages special command-line tools that aren't in the regular software store.
You don't have Homebrew installed. That's fine - you probably don't need it unless you're a developer.

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 3 — Updating Your Core System Software
# ------------------------------------------------------------


📦 Now for the important part - updating your system's core software. This includes security fixes and bug repairs.

This is like getting oil changes for your car - it keeps everything running smoothly and safely.

🔧 Now I'm going to: refresh the list of available updates
   (Test mode: Just checking what would happen)
   Command: sudo apt update

🔧 Let me make sure nothing is broken before we start...

🔧 Now I'm going to: check and fix broken packages
   (Test mode: Just checking what would happen)
   Command: sudo apt -f install -y

📋 Checking what needs updating...
Great news! Your system is already up to date.

🧹 Now let me clean up old stuff you don't need...

🔧 Now I'm going to: remove packages that are no longer needed
   (Test mode: Just checking what would happen)
   Command: sudo apt autoremove --purge -y

🔧 Now I'm going to: clean up the package download cache
   (Test mode: Just checking what would happen)
   Command: sudo apt clean

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 4 — Checking for Package Issues
# ------------------------------------------------------------


🔍 Let me check if any software is being held back or if there are any orphaned packages taking up space...
✅ No packages are being held back. Good!

🧹 Found 2 orphaned packages that aren't needed anymore:
   libieee1284-3t64:amd64
   libpgm-5.3-0t64:amd64

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 5 — Updating Desktop Applications (Flatpak)
# ------------------------------------------------------------


📱 Flatpak apps are like phone apps - they run in their own secure space and update independently.

🔄 Updating your Flatpak applications...
You have 11 Flatpak apps installed.

🔧 Now I'm going to: update all Flatpak apps
   (Test mode: Just checking what would happen)
   Command: flatpak update -y

🔧 Now I'm going to: remove unused Flatpak data
   (Test mode: Just checking what would happen)
   Command: flatpak uninstall --unused -y

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 6 — Updating Snap Applications
# ------------------------------------------------------------


📦 Snap is another app system, similar to Flatpak. Let me check for updates and clean up old versions...
Snap isn't installed. That's fine - Flatpak is usually preferred anyway.

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 7 — Updating Python Tools
# ------------------------------------------------------------


🐍 If you have any Python tools installed, let me update them for you...

Python tools are programming utilities. Even if you're not a programmer, some apps might have installed these.

💡 Note: Ubuntu 24.04 protects system Python. Use pipx for installing Python applications safely.

Checking pipx-managed Python applications...
No pipx applications installed.

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 8 — Checking Standalone Applications
# ------------------------------------------------------------


🎯 Let me check for applications that need manual updates...
This includes AppImages and applications installed in /opt.

📦 Checking for AppImage applications...

📋 Found 5 AppImage applications:
   • Cursor-1.2.1-x86_64
   • Obsidian-1.8.7
   • MediaElch_linux_2.12.0_2024-10-13_git-8032465
   • cursor
   • webamp-desktop-0.3.0-x86_64

💡 These apps need to be updated manually by downloading new versions from their websites. Consider switching to Flatpak versions if available for automatic updates.

📁 Checking applications in /opt directory...

   • PDF Studio: Check Help menu for updates
   • WonderPen: Check in-app updates
   • GitKraken: Updates automatically or check Help menu
   • Docker Desktop: Check system tray icon for updates

⚠️  These applications typically update through their own built-in updaters or need manual downloads.

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 9 — Checking Device Firmware Updates
# ------------------------------------------------------------


🔧 Firmware is the low-level software that runs your hardware devices. Let me check if any updates are available...

This might find updates for:
   • Your computer's BIOS/UEFI
   • SSD/hard drive firmware
   • Thunderbolt controllers
   • Other hardware components

🔧 Now I'm going to: refresh firmware update list
   (Test mode: Just checking what would happen)
   Command: fwupdmgr refresh

🔍 Checking what firmware updates are available...
(Test mode: Would check for firmware updates)

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 10 — Cleaning Up System Log Files
# ------------------------------------------------------------


📚 Your system keeps detailed logs of everything it does. Over time, these can take up quite a bit of space.

Let me clean up logs older than 2 weeks...
Current log storage: 343.9M

🔧 Now I'm going to: clean up old system logs (keep 2 weeks)
   (Test mode: Just checking what would happen)
   Command: sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=2weeks --vacuum-size=500M
Log storage after cleanup: 343.9M

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 11 — Removing Old System Kernels
# ------------------------------------------------------------


🖥️ The kernel is the core of your operating system. When it updates, old versions are kept as backups.

Let me clean up old kernels, keeping the newest 2...
You currently have 9 kernels installed.

🔧 Now I'm going to: remove old kernels (keeping newest 2)
   (Test mode: Just checking what would happen)
   Command: sudo purge-old-kernels -y 2

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 12 — Checking Hard Drive Health
# ------------------------------------------------------------


💾 Let me check if your storage drives are healthy...

Checking 5 storage device(s)...

📊 Checking /dev/sda...
   ✅ Healthy!

📊 Checking /dev/nvme2n1...
   ✅ Healthy!

📊 Checking /dev/nvme1n1...
   ✅ Healthy!

📊 Checking /dev/nvme0n1...
   ✅ Healthy!

💡 Tip: For a thorough test, run: sudo smartctl -t long /dev/sdX
   (Replace sdX with your drive name)

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 13 — Updating Desktop Extensions
# ------------------------------------------------------------


🧩 GNOME extensions customize your desktop experience. Let me check for updates...
You have 8 extensions enabled.

🔧 Now I'm going to: update GNOME extensions
   (Test mode: Just checking what would happen)
   Command: gnome-extensions update

💡 For more control, use the Extension Manager app from Software Center.

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 14 — Cleaning Up Docker Containers
# ------------------------------------------------------------


🐳 Docker is used for running containerized applications. Let me check if cleanup is needed...

Docker is installed but not running. Let me start it...
(Test mode: Would start Docker service)

📊 Current Docker disk usage:

🔍 Checking what can be cleaned up...
This would remove:
   • All stopped containers
   • All networks not used by containers
   • All dangling images
   • All build cache
✅ Docker is already clean!

📊 Docker disk usage after cleanup:

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 15 — Refreshing File Search Database
# ------------------------------------------------------------


🔍 Your system maintains a database of all files for quick searching. Let me update it...

This helps the 'locate' command find files instantly.

🔧 Now I'm going to: scan all files and update search database
   (Test mode: Just checking what would happen)
   Command: sudo updatedb

⏱️ Note: This can take a while on large drives with many files (like cloud storage folders).

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 16 — Deep Cleaning Temporary Files
# ------------------------------------------------------------


🧹 BleachBit is like CCleaner for Linux - it removes temporary files, caches, and other junk.

This will clean things like:
   • Web browser caches
   • Temporary files
   • Old logs
   • Thumbnail caches

📋 Available cleaning options:
   adobe_reader.cache
   adobe_reader.mru
   adobe_reader.tmp
   amsn.cache
   amsn.chat_logs
   amule.backup
   amule.known_clients
   amule.known_files
   amule.logs
   amule.temp

🔧 Now I'm going to: perform deep clean (browser cache, temp files, logs)
   (Test mode: Just checking what would happen)
   Command: bleachbit --clean system.cache system.tmp

💡 Run BleachBit (GUI) to customize what gets cleaned.

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 17 — Optimizing SSD Performance
# ------------------------------------------------------------


⚡ If you have an SSD (solid-state drive), it needs periodic optimization to maintain performance.

This process is called 'trimming' and helps the drive manage deleted data efficiently.

🔧 Now I'm going to: optimize all SSD drives
   (Test mode: Just checking what would happen)
   Command: sudo fstrim -av

📝 Note: You'll see errors for non-SSD drives or filesystems that don't support trimming. This is normal!

💡 Your system should do this automatically weekly, but running it manually ensures it's done.

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter 18 — Checking Overall System Health
# ------------------------------------------------------------
